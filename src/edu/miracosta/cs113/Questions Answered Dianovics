RANDOM:
How often get this solution in fewer than 20 guesses?
        Never. And there is nothing good about this other than the fact that it is trying something.
        The theory tested matters very little since it is always random.

MINE:
How often get this solution in fewer than 20 guesses?
        Every time. The 20 is hit only when the solution is the very last option in the list, ie, the weapon
        is the 6th one, the location is the 10th one, etc.

        This happens because we start at the beginning (1) for each option and then increment the weapon/location/murder
        by 1 each time it is confirmed that the solution is incorrect.

        This depends on whether it is the first solution (1,1,1) or if it is the very last option (6,10,6). Since the
        (1,1,1) is the very first option, it is returned the fastest. The (6,10,6) is the very last option and will return
        with the most tries, 20. Random choices would be in between those two tries (1 for the least, and 20 for the most)
        and therefore will return somewhere in between 1 and 20 guesses.

        That is what is good about the strategy, a logical progression of guesses. What is bad, is that I couldn't get it
        to guess under 20.
